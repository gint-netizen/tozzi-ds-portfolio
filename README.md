**📄 Important Note**

The **Passenger Satisfaction Prediction** notebook may display as *“Invalid Notebook”* in GitHub’s preview because it was developed in **Google Colab**, which adds metadata that GitHub cannot render.  
It remains fully functional and can be viewed by clicking on the **“Code”** tab above the file.  

An official **MIT IDSS Hackathon Certificate** is also included, confirming my **3rd place (Second Runner Up)** ranking across all program cohorts.
